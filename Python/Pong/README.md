This is a simple entry level Python game that uses the built in Turtle module to create and move animations around the screen.

The two main things I learned from this project:
1. How to make animated objects interact with each other using XY screen coordinates and if statements.
2. How to use the keys on the keyboard to control the actions of objects on the screen.
